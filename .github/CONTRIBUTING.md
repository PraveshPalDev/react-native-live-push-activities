# Contributing to React Native Live Push Activities

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `react-native-live-push-activities`!

To ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, we have established the following rules.

---

## 🚫 Pull Requests Without an Issue Will Be Closed

**Before you write any code**:

1.  **Check existing issues**: Is there already an issue for your bug or feature request?
2.  **Open a NEW Issue**: If no issue exists, please open one first.
    - Describe the bug or feature in detail.
    - Wait for approval or discussion before starting work.

**We do NOT accept Pull Requests that are not linked to an approved Issue.**
This prevents wasted effort on changes that might not align with the project's goals.

## 📝 Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Naming Convention**:
    - Branches: `feat/issue-number-description` or `fix/issue-number-description`
    - Commits: Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add new timer attribute`).
3.  **Link the Issue**:
    - In your PR description, you **MUST** include: `Closes #<issue_number>` or `Fixes #<issue_number>`.
4.  **Testing**:
    - Ensure your changes work on both iOS and Android (even if Android is just a placeholder).
    - Update documentation if you change the API.

---

## 🔒 Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and improved-focused.
- Harassment or abuse will not be tolerated.

## 👑 Merging Policy

**Only repository maintainers (PraveshPalDev) can merge Pull Requests.**

- Do not merge your own PRs.
- Do not ask for merges if the CI checks are failing.
- Approved PRs will be merged by the maintainer after review.

Thank you for helping us build the best Live Activities library!
